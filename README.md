🎨 Front End Libraries

This repository contains projects completed as part of the Front End Libraries Certification, focusing on building interactive and responsive user interfaces using modern JavaScript libraries and web technologies.

The projects in this repository were built using:

HTML5 – Semantic structure and accessibility

CSS3 – Styling, layout, and responsive design

JavaScript (ES6+) – Application logic and interactivity

JSX – Component-based UI structure within React

React – Building dynamic, reusable user interface components


📚 What This Repository Demonstrates

Through these projects, I applied:

State and props management

Event handling and conditional rendering

Responsive design principles

Clean separation of structure (HTML/JSX), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript)

These projects demonstrate practical understanding of modern front-end development workflows.
